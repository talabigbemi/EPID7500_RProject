# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The way you can create a file like this in RStudio is: File → New File → R Markdown and then using the default or using a template.

## You can use hashtags to create headers.  The more hastage the more indented the header

Below is a code chunk that will set up our packages and data. 
```{r}
library(readxl)
dtp <- read_excel("../data/DTP_Coverage_WHO.xlsx", sheet="Data")
head(dtp, n=5)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Exercise 1

Create a chunk of code below that loads the tidyverse package (hint: use library function), but change the options so that I don't see the output of the loaded package.
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse") 
```

## Exercise 2

Create a code chunk below that creates a new data frame called `dtp1.nig.df` that only includes data from Nigeria (hint: NAME is "Nigeria") and DTP containing vaccine dose 1 (hint: ANTIGEN is "DTPCV1") and only WUENIC estimates (hint: COVERAGE_CATEGORY is "WUENIC"). Output the number of rows of data are in this new data frame, `dtp1.nig.df`?
```{r}
dtpl.nig.df <- filter(NAME == "Nigeria", ANTIGEN == "DTPCV1", COVERAGE_CATEROGY == "WUENIC")
```

## Exercise 3 

Create a code chunk below that modifies the data frame such that it only induces the following variables: NAME, YEAR, ANTIGEN, COVERAGE_CATEGORY, COVERAGE. Output the first 8 rows of this data frame. Output the number of columns in this modified data frame
```{r}
dtpl.nig.df <- select(NAME, YEAR, ANTIGEN, COVERAGE_CATEGORY, COVERAGE)
```


## Exercise 4

Create a code chunk below that outputs the mean dtp dose 1 coverage from Nigeria across all years.


## Exercise 5

Use the code chunk below to plot DTP coverage over time. Basically you just need to fill in the variable names for `x=` and `y=`.  Below the code chunk interpret the plot for me. 


## Exercise 6

Knit this file. Save the .pdf in output subdirectory of you RProject as "Day4_Lab_RMarkdown.pdf"
