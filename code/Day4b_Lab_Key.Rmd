# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The way you can create a file like this in RStudio is: File → New File → R Markdown and then using the default or using a template.

## You can use hashtags to create headers.  The more hastage the more indented the header

Below is a code chunk that will set up our packages and data. 
```{r}
library(readxl)
dtp <- read_excel("../data/DTP_Coverage_WHO.xlsx", sheet="Data")
head(dtp, n=5)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Exercise 1

Create a chunk of code below that loads the tidyverse package (hint: use library function), but change the options so that I don't see the output of the loaded package.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Exercise 2

Create a code chunk below that creates a new data frame called `dtp1.nig.df` that only includes data from Nigeria (hint: NAME is "Nigeria") and DTP containing vaccine dose 1 (hint: ANTIGEN is "DTPCV1") and only WUENIC estimates (hint: COVERAGE_CATEGORY is "WUENIC"). Output the number of rows of data are in this new data frame, `dtp1.nig.df`?

```{r}
dtp1.nig.df <- dtp %>%
  filter(NAME=="Nigeria" & ANTIGEN=="DTPCV1" & COVERAGE_CATEGORY=="WUENIC")
nrow(dtp1.nig.df)
```

## Exercise 3 

Create a code chunk below that modifies the data frame such that it only induces the following variables: NAME, YEAR, ANTIGEN, COVERAGE_CATEGORY, COVERAGE. Output the first 8 rows of this data frame. Output the number of columns in this modified data frame

```{r}
dtp1.nig.df <- dtp1.nig.df %>%
  select(NAME, YEAR, ANTIGEN, COVERAGE_CATEGORY, COVERAGE)
ncol(dtp1.nig.df)
```
 

## Exercise 4

Create a code chunk below that outputs the mean dtp dose 1 coverage from Nigeria across all years.

```{r}
mean(dtp1.nig.df$COVERAGE)
dtp1.nig.df %>% select(COVERAGE) %>% summary()
dtp1.nig.df %>% summarise(mean(COVERAGE))
```

## Exercise 5

Use the code chunk below to plot DTP coverage over time. Basically you just need to fill in the variable names for `x=` and `y=`.  Below the code chunk interpret the plot for me. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = dtp1.nig.df) + geom_line(aes(x=YEAR, y=COVERAGE)) + 
  labs(title = "Nigeria DTP1 Coverage, WUENIC Estimates")
```

Explanation of plot here...

## Exercise 6

install.packages("tinytex")
library(tinytex)
install_tinytex()
